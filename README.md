# kivy-service-restart
I am trying to build a rudimentary app with Kivy on android to understand the fundamentals of service.

I am trying to make my **service restart**, but I didn't succeed.

the service work but doesnâ€™t restart
the code doesn't give an error
Does someone know what I did wrong?

**the architecture of my file:**
 
              -buildozer.spec
              -scr
                |-> main.py
                |-> service.py
